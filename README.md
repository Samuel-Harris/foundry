# Relay

![Relay](assets/logo.png)

Relay bridges the gap between AI coding sessions. It equips Cursor with commands for structured handoffs, automatic documentation upkeep, and git diff context — giving agents the awareness they need to stay aligned with your current work, no matter when or where they pick up the thread.

As a Cursor plugin, Relay exposes a `handoff` command (defined in `.cursor-plugin/commands/handoff.md`) that guides you through creating a structured handoff document whenever you are approaching the context window limit.

To validate, run `node scripts/validate-template.mjs`.
