# Cursor Repo Optimisation

Audit a repository's Cursor configuration, indexing setup, rules, hooks, documentation, and workflows. Produce a prioritised report of recommendations.

**Reference files in this skill:**

- `references/audit-commands.md` — Bash commands for each audit area
- `references/audit-process.md` — Parallel and sequential audit workflows
- `references/migration-examples.md` — Migration formats and example recommendations
- `scripts/validate-artefacts.sh` — Validate frontmatter for skills, rules, and subagents

## Important: Consult the Cursor Documentation

Cursor evolves rapidly. Always consult these sources for the latest information:

- https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules — Rules configuration
- https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills — Skills configuration
- https://cursor.com/docs/context/subagents — Subagents configuration
- https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks — Hooks system
- https://cursor.com/docs/plugins — Plugins and marketplace
- https://cursor.com/changelog — Changelog

## Scope

This skill has two phases: **audit** then **implementation**. During the audit phase, do not make changes to the repository — present findings as a prioritised report. Implementation only happens after the user approves specific recommendations (see "After the Report").

For AGENTS.md creation and updates, refer to the **deepinit** skill.

---

## Verify Before Recommending

**CRITICAL:** Before including any recommendation in the report, verify that it is actually needed by reading the relevant files.

**Common verification failures:**

- Recommending a capability that already exists in a different form (e.g., a command that orchestrates something you thought was missing)
- Suggesting migrations for artefacts that are already correctly configured
- Flagging files for indexing exclusion when they're already in `.cursorindexingignore`
- Proposing new workflows without checking if existing skills/commands already implement them

**For each potential recommendation:**

1. Read the relevant configuration files to confirm the gap exists
2. If recommending changes to commands/skills/rules, read those files first
3. If suggesting new capabilities, check whether they already exist in a different form
4. Cross-reference with existing `.cursor/` artefacts to avoid redundant suggestions

**Example:** Before recommending "add MCP server for Linear", check if Linear integration already exists via `.cursor/mcp.json` or an existing skill.

## Decision Tree: Where Should This Information Live?

```
Is this information needed on EVERY request, regardless of what files are being worked on?
├─ YES → Is it under ~5 lines?
│   ├─ YES → Root AGENTS.md
│   └─ NO → Always-apply rule (but question whether it truly needs to be always-on)
├─ NO → Is it specific to a subdirectory, package, or service?
│   ├─ YES → Is it identity/orientation info (purpose, structure, key files, local conventions)?
│   │   ├─ YES → Subdirectory AGENTS.md (loaded when agent works near those files; wins by proximity)
│   │   └─ NO → Is it procedural (multi-step "how to do X")?
│   │       ├─ YES → Skill scoped to that area
│   │       └─ NO → Glob-scoped rule (e.g., `globs: ["api/**/*.py"]`)
│   └─ NO → Does the agent need to decide when it's relevant?
│       ├─ YES → Is it procedural (multi-step "how to do X")?
│       │   ├─ YES → Skill (SKILL.md)
│       │   └─ NO → Apply-intelligently rule (description, no globs)
│       └─ NO → Is it triggered by an explicit user action?
│           ├─ YES → Command (`.cursor/commands/`)
│           └─ NO → Subagent (`.cursor/agents/`) if it needs isolated
│                   context, otherwise skill
```

### Artefact Type Reference

| Artefact                         | Nature                   | Loading                        | Best For                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AGENTS.md                        | Passive, always loaded   | Every request                  | Project identity, directory map, universal constraints (~100 lines) |
| Always-apply rule                | Passive, always loaded   | Every request                  | Universal coding style, language preferences (use sparingly)        |
| Glob-scoped rule                 | Passive, auto-attached   | When matching files in context | Area-specific conventions (API patterns, migrations, tests)         |
| Skill                            | Active, agent-discovered | When task matches description  | Procedural workflows, domain expertise, multi-step "how-to"         |
| Skill (disable-model-invocation) | Active, user-invoked     | Only when user types `/skill`  | Saved prompts, repeatable workflows user triggers explicitly        |
| Subagent                         | Active, delegated        | When parent agent delegates    | Tasks needing isolated context, parallel execution                  |

#### Legacy Artefact Types

| Artefact                    | Status          | Notes                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Apply-intelligently rule    | Still supported | Consider migrating to skill if it contains multi-step procedures or would benefit from `references/` structure |
| Command (.cursor/commands/) | Still supported | Skills with `disable-model-invocation: true` are the newer alternative                                         |

**Note:** Cursor includes a `/migrate-to-skills` command that can convert apply-intelligently rules and commands to skills if desired.

**The acid test:** If it tells the agent _how to behave_, it's a rule. If it tells the agent _how to do something_, it's a skill. If it's a prompt you're tired of retyping, it's a skill with `disable-model-invocation: true`. If it needs a clean context window, it's a subagent.

## Audit Checklist

For bash commands to run for each area, see `references/audit-commands.md`.

### 1. Indexing Exclusions

Check `.cursorignore`, `.cursorindexingignore`, and `.gitignore`. The key distinction:

- `.cursorignore` — Files invisible to Cursor entirely
- `.cursorindexingignore` — Files excluded from index but manually includable via `@file`

**Flag for exclusion:** Large reference docs, scraped data, database snapshots, generated code, binary content, build artefacts, vendored dependencies.

### 2. Rules Configuration

| Mode                    | Frontmatter                                | Guidance                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always Apply            | `alwaysApply: true`                        | Use sparingly — loads on every request                                    |
| Apply to Specific Files | `alwaysApply: false` + `globs: <patterns>` | Preferred for area-specific rules                                         |
| Apply Intelligently     | `description` only, no globs               | Agent decides based on description; consider skill for procedural content |
| Apply Manually          | No globs, no description                   | Only when `@`-mentioned                                                   |

**Anti-patterns:** God rules (>500 lines), procedural rules (should be skills), stale rules, conflicting rules, overly broad globs.

**Sizing:** Individual rules <500 lines, all always-apply rules combined <200 lines.

### 3. AGENTS.md Documentation

**Bloated signs:** >100 lines at root, detailed command references, area-specific conventions, procedural instructions.

**Too thin signs:** No directory map, no tech stack, no build/test commands, no critical constraints.

### 4. Context Weight Optimisation

| Context type                | Budget         |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Root AGENTS.md              | ~100 lines     |
| All always-apply rules      | ~200 lines     |
| **Total always-on context** | **<300 lines** |
| Individual glob-scoped rule | ~200 lines max |
| Skill SKILL.md body         | ~500 lines max |

**Red flags:** Root AGENTS.md >200 lines, >3 always-apply rules, single rule >500 lines.

### 5. Hooks

Check `.cursor/hooks.json` for hook configuration. Format requires `version: 1` and hooks object:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "hookName": [{ "command": "./script.sh", "matcher": "pattern" }]
  }
}
```

High-value hook patterns:

- `sessionStart` — Inject branch name, ticket, environment context via `env` and `additional_context` output
- `preToolUse` with `matcher: "Shell"` — Validate or transform shell commands
- `beforeShellExecution` — Block dangerous commands (exit code 2 to deny)
- `afterFileEdit` — Run formatters/linters after agent edits
- `stop` — Prompt handoff notes, auto-retry logic via `followup_message`

Available hooks: `sessionStart`, `sessionEnd`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `postToolUseFailure`, `subagentStart`, `subagentStop`, `beforeShellExecution`, `afterShellExecution`, `beforeMCPExecution`, `afterMCPExecution`, `beforeReadFile`, `afterFileEdit`, `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `preCompact`, `stop`, `afterAgentResponse`, `afterAgentThought`, `beforeTabFileRead`, `afterTabFileEdit`

### 6. Generated and Binary Files

Flag: Auto-generated types (OpenAPI/protobuf), compiled output, SQL dumps, LFS-tracked paths, large test fixtures.

### 7. Codebase Indexing Settings

UI settings to verify (Cursor Settings > Features):

- **Codebase Indexing** enabled
- **Include Project Structure** enabled
- Indexing status shows fully indexed

### 8. Skills

**Skills are the preferred format for:**

- Multi-step procedural workflows
- Domain-specific expertise that benefits from `references/` subdirectories
- User-invoked prompts (with `disable-model-invocation: true`)

**Check:** Does `.cursor/skills/` exist? Do skills use progressive disclosure (lean SKILL.md, heavy docs in `references/`)? Would any apply-intelligently rules benefit from skill structure?

**Note:** Cursor includes a built-in `/migrate-to-skills` command that can convert apply-intelligently rules and commands to skills.

### 9. Artefact Validation

**IMPORTANT:** Read each artefact file to verify correct structure. Don't just check existence.

Run `scripts/validate-artefacts.sh` from the project root for automated validation of skills, rules, and subagent frontmatter.

#### Skill Frontmatter (Required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---
```

**Optional fields:**

- `disable-model-invocation: true` — For user-invoked-only skills (replacement for commands)

**Common errors:**

- Missing frontmatter entirely (no `---` block)
- Missing `name` field
- Missing `description` field (agent won't discover the skill)
- Empty or placeholder description

#### Rule Frontmatter

| Rule Type    | Required Frontmatter                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Always-apply | `alwaysApply: true`                            |
| Glob-scoped  | `alwaysApply: false` + `globs: <patterns>`     |
| Manual-only  | No `alwaysApply`, no `globs`, no `description` |

**Common errors:**

- `globs:` present but empty
- Both `alwaysApply: true` AND `globs` (redundant — always-apply ignores globs)

**Note:** `alwaysApply: false` without `globs` but with a `description` is the valid "Apply Intelligently" pattern.

#### Subagent Frontmatter

All fields are optional but recommended for discoverability:

```yaml
---
name: subagent-name # Defaults to filename without extension
description: What this subagent does and when to use it
model: inherit # Options: fast, inherit, or specific model ID
readonly: true # For read-only subagents
is_background: false # Run asynchronously without blocking parent
---
```

**Best practices:**

- Include `description` for automatic delegation (agent reads this to decide when to use the subagent)
- Use `readonly: true` for review/audit subagents
- Use `is_background: true` for long-running tasks that don't need to block
- Include "use proactively" in description to encourage automatic delegation

### 10. Commands (Legacy)

Commands in `.cursor/commands/` still work but skills with `disable-model-invocation: true` are the newer alternative. Cursor's built-in `/migrate-to-skills` command can convert them automatically. See `references/migration-examples.md` for manual migration format.

### 11. Subagents

Check `.cursor/agents/` for focused, well-described subagents. The `model` field is optional (`inherit` is the default).

High-value patterns: debugger, security auditor, test writer, documentation specialist, code reviewer.

### 12. MCP Server Configuration

Check `.cursor/mcp.json` or `mcp.json`. Only suggest MCP servers for services the project actually uses (verify in package.json, requirements.txt, docker-compose).

### 13. Plugins and Marketplace

Plugins are installed from the [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) and bundle rules, skills, agents, commands, MCP servers, and hooks. Check Cursor Settings > Rules for installed plugins.

For creating plugins: requires `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest. See https://cursor.com/docs/plugins/building for format.

### 14. Sandbox Configuration

Check `sandbox.json` for network and filesystem access controls.

### 15. Content Placement Analysis

Apply the **Decision Tree** (above) to evaluate whether content is correctly placed across AGENTS.md files, rules, and skills.

**Reading requirements:**

- **All** AGENTS.md files in the repository
- All rules in `.cursor/rules/`
- All skills: both `SKILL.md` and any files in subdirectories (e.g., `references/`, `scripts/`)

**Use subagents** to parallelise reading across major directories (e.g., backend/, frontend/, terraform/).

**For each section >10 lines, ask:**

1. Is this needed on every request? → If no, shouldn't be in root AGENTS.md or always-apply rule
2. Is this scoped to specific files/directories? → Should be a glob-scoped rule
3. Is this procedural ("how to do X")? → Should be a skill
4. Is this guidance ("how to behave")? → Should be a rule

**Flag content that should move:**

| Current Location  | Content Type                          | Should Be        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| AGENTS.md         | Procedural instructions               | Skill            |
| AGENTS.md         | Area-specific conventions (>50 lines) | Glob-scoped rule |
| Always-apply rule | Area-specific content                 | Glob-scoped rule |
| Rule              | Multi-step procedures                 | Skill            |
| Skill             | Passive guidance only                 | Rule             |

## Audit Process

See `references/audit-process.md` for detailed parallel and sequential audit workflows.

**Quick summary:**

1. Read config files (.cursorignore, .cursorindexingignore, .gitignore, .cursorrules, hooks.json, mcp.json, sandbox.json, AGENTS.md)
2. List `.cursor/` directory contents
3. Identify legacy artefacts that may benefit from migration (apply-intelligently rules, commands)
4. Check for index pollution (large directories, generated code, binary files)
5. Measure context weight
6. Check Cursor documentation for new features
7. **Content placement analysis** — apply Decision Tree to all AGENTS.md files, rules, and skills (including skill subdirectories)
8. **Verify each recommendation** — read relevant files to confirm gaps exist before including in report

---

## Output Format

Present findings as a prioritised report:

```
## Cursor Optimisation Report

### P0 — Critical (high impact, low effort)
[Recommendations that significantly improve indexing, search quality, or context efficiency]

### P1 — Important (high impact, moderate effort)
[Recommendations that improve developer experience or reduce repetitive work]

### P2 — Recommended (moderate impact)
[Recommendations that would improve the setup but are not urgent]

### P3 — Nice to Have (lower impact or beta features)
[Recommendations for newer or experimental features]

### Already Well Configured
[Areas that are already set up correctly — acknowledge good practices]

### Settings to Verify Manually
[UI-only settings the user should check in Cursor Settings]
```

For each recommendation, include:

- **What** to change
- **Why** it matters
- **Specific file contents or changes** to make

See `references/migration-examples.md` for example recommendations.

---

## After the Report

Once the prioritised report is complete:

1. **List every actionable recommendation** as a numbered summary (one line each, referencing the priority level, e.g. `[P0] Exclude backend/vector_db/public_documents/ from indexing`)

2. **Ask the user** which items they would like implemented:

   > Which of these would you like me to implement? You can specify by number (e.g. "1, 3, 5"), a priority level (e.g. "all P0 and P1"), or say "all".

3. **Wait for the user's response**, then implement only the selected items.
